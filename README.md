I have created a map of passport ratings of European countries

The visualization was created in R using ggplot2, rnaturalearth, dplyr, sf.

Top 3 countries by the number of visa-free countries:
France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸, Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª, Italy ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ - visa-free access to 194 countries (also worldwide)
Finland ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡®, Ireland ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª, ğŸ‡± ğŸ‡º Luxembourg, ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡± Netherlands, Sweden ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª, Austria ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ - access without a visa in 193 countries.
Belgium, Denmark, Great Britain - visa-free access to 192 countries.

Anti-top 3 countries by the number of visa-free countries:
Armenia - access to 69 countries.
Azerbaijan - access to 72 countries.
Kosovo - access to 76 countries.

The passport of Kazakhstan allows its citizens to travel without a visa to 78 countries. 

Kosovo has visa-free entry to the countries of the Schengen Agreement, which is a significant achievement for a partially recognized state. At the same time, Kosovo has a low rating - access to 76 countries without a visa.

The best passport among the post-Soviet countries outside the EU belongs to Ukraine. Ukrainian citizens can travel to 143 countries without a visa.
